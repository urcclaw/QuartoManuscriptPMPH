# ABSTRACT

**Objectives:** Preliminary research suggests that rectally administered nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may reduce the incidence of pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, we assigned patients at elevated risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis to receive a single dose of rectal indomethacin or placebo immediately after ERCP. Patients were determined to be at high risk on the basis of validated patient- and procedure-related risk factors. The primary outcome was post-ERCP pancreatitis, which was defined as new upper abdominal pain, an elevation in pancreatic enzymes to at least three times the upper limit of the normal range 24 hours after the procedure, and hospitalization for at least 2 nights.

**Results:** A total of 602 patients were enrolled and completed follow-up. The majority of patients (82%) had a clinical suspicion of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Post-ERCP pancreatitis developed in 27 of 295 patients (9.2%) in the indomethacin group and in 52 of 307 patients (16.9%) in the placebo group (P=0.005). Moderate-to-severe pancreatitis developed in 13 patients (4.4%) in the indomethacin group and in 27 patients (8.8%) in the placebo group (P=0.03).

**Conclusions:** Among patients at high risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis, rectal indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of the condition. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00820612. opens in new tab.)

# RESULTS

## Patients

From February 2009 through July 2011, the data and safety monitoring board performed an interim analysis to assess the outcomes of the first 600 patients and recommended that the study be terminated early on the basis of the benefit of indomethacin as compared with placebo. Thus, we terminated the study according to the a priori stopping rule.

Baseline characteristics were similar in the two study groups (@tbl-characteristics-baseline). Notably, of patients had a clinical suspicion of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.

## Heterogeneity in Treatment Effects

The relative benefit of indomethacin did not vary significantly according to patients' pretreatment risk score, although the absolute risk reduction varied from an NNT of 21 for those with a risk score of 1 (one major or two minor inclusion criteria) to an NNT of 6 for those with a risk score of 5 (e.g., four major and two minor inclusion criteria) (@fig-heterogeneity).

## Exploratory Subgroup Analyses

The beneficial effect of indomethacin on the primary outcome was also consistent across the other prespecified and post hoc secondary subgroups (@fig-exploratory-subgroup). In particular, indomethacin appeared to be protective regardless of whether patients had undergone pancreatic stenting or had a clinical suspicion of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction; indomethacin was also protective in all three subtypes of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and in the two study sites enrolling the largest number of patients.
